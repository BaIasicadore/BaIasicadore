    All you need to know:

        <br>
        <br>
        Balasicadore is a hundred percent weird word.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Balasicadore is hard to read just by looking at the word. It is dotted with many syllables but OwO has only two syllables.

        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, the most important part, OwO is more popular than balasicadore. Current owo fans like karmo were balasicadore supporters <br> before they changed their minds. This shows how great OwO is.
